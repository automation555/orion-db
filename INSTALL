How to install OrionDB:

Requirements:

- PHP version 5.2 or later
- if you want to use MySQL: version 5 or later
- if you want to use PostgreSQL: version 8 or later.

- copy the config.php.sample file to config.php and set all the values. Read 
  the comments for more information or go to the wiki.
- copy the htaccess.sample file to .htaccess and set the rewrite rule according 
  to the example
- if you want to use the log file, make sure it exists and set up the 
  permissions to allow the user running the webserver to write to it 
  (chmod 777 filename.log will always work :-) )
- Happy DB-ing and SC-ing!

How to update OrionDB:

In the configuration file the changes are minimal. One option has been added and 
4 options have been renamed. You can use the same configuration file, as long as you 
perform the following changes manually:

 Add: $ORIONDBCFG_DB_type = "mysql"; // For now choose between 'mysql' and 'postgresql' 
 
 Change the name of the following options:
   
  $ORIONDBCFG_MySQL_host = "localhost";
  $ORIONDBCFG_MySQL_user = "db_user";
  $ORIONDBCFG_MySQL_password = "db_passwd";
  $ORIONDBCFG_MySQL_dbname = "dbname";
  
  to: 
  
  $ORIONDBCFG_DB_host = "localhost";
  $ORIONDBCFG_DB_user = "db_user";
  $ORIONDBCFG_DB_password = "db_passwd";
  $ORIONDBCFG_DB_dbname = "dbname";

That's it!
