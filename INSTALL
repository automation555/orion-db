How to install OrionDB:


- copy the config.php.sample file to config.php and set all the values.
- if you want to use the log file, make sure it exists and allow the apache user to write to it
- make sure the .htaccess files are working 
- make sure your model names match the table names in MySQL (case sensitive!)
