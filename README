About OrionDB

OrionDB is a generic PHP REST front end to a MySQL database for the Sproutcore RestServer.
The following requirements for getting it to work need to be met:

- PHP 5 with version 5.2 or later
- Apache with .htaccess overrides and mod_rewrite configured.
- MySQL version 5 or later

To use OrionDB, the names of your MySQL tables need to exactly match your Sproutcore model names.
This results in calls to the server like 

http://host/path/to/resource/tablename.

Before you can use it actively, read the INSTALL file on how to configure OrionDB properly.

NOTE: The current version of OrionDB expects the browser to be able to do GET,POST,PUT and DELETE methods. 

If you do not get it working, please check the wiki at http://github.com/mauritslamers/orion-db/wikis/

If you find a bug, please file a ticket on http://oriondb.lighthouseapp.com and please include a fix if you are able to write one!
