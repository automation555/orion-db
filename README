About OrionDB

OrionDB is a generic PHP REST front end to a database for Sproutcore. 
It has a plugin structure to support multiple database types.
At the moment MySQL is fully supported and support for PostgreSQL is underway.

OrionDB has the following requirements:

- PHP 5 with version 5.2 or later
- Apache with .htaccess overrides and mod_rewrite configured.

and depending on what database you intend to use 
- MySQL version 5 or later
- PostgreSQL8 or later

To use OrionDB, the names of your tables must match your 
Sproutcore model names (case insensitive). This results in calls to the server 
like:

http://host/path/to/resource/tablename.

Before you use it, please read the INSTALL file on how to configure 
OrionDB.

NOTE: The current version of OrionDB expects the browser to be able to do GET,
POST, PUT and DELETE methods. 

If you do not get it working, please check the wiki at 
http://github.com/mauritslamers/orion-db/wikis/

If you find a bug, please file a ticket on 
http://mauritslamers.lighthouseapp.com/projects/19148-oriondb/overview 
and please include a fix if you are able to write one!
