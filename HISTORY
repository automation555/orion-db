HISTORY

January 2009
The dependency on the MySQL database engine has been removed.
OrionDB is able to support different database types by using database plugins.
The original MySQL support has been moved to the plugin and OrionDB has become
more or less database agnostic, as long as standard SQL is supported by the 
database engine.
For updating instructions please read the INSTALL file.
